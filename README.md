The objective of this project is to forecast the sales volume of a specific item, such as Kit-Kat chocolate, for the upcoming years of 2023-2024. To accomplish this task, we will utilize the Linear Regression Model, which is a statistical method used to establish a relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, sales volume) and one or more independent variables (times).
